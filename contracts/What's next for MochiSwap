What's next for MochiSwap

Yesterday we realeased MOCHI token and 3 yield farms with BNB-MOCHI, BUSD-MOCHI, and DOGE-MOCHI. Everything went well
and we are seeing the same type of activity seen in a lot of yield-farm only token projects, initial excitement subsides
and you have to figure out where to go next. Luckily, we started testing ideas for this project over 6 months ago 
and have a pretty good idea of where we are going in the short term


1. Relase 3 new pools
  - Solo MOCHI staking
  - ETH-MOCHI
  - ADA-MOCHI
  
  We want to work with high-quality and high-liquidity assets. We think these are good examples and intend to curate our ecosystem to favor a smaller set of high quality assets than found in other farms and DEX platforms.

2. Add timelock to chef contract.
  We have already handed off ownership of the token contract to the chef contract and after we add the 3 pairs listed above we will be
  moving ownership of the chef contract to a timelock contract that adds a 48-hour buffer to any administrative functions on the chef contract. This will prevent abuse of the migrator functionality by allowing users to see any modifications we make to the contracts
  2 days before they go into effect.

3. Deploy and test native DEX/liquidity pools.
  We intend to develop and work with our own liquidity pools, which will allow us to make MOCHI the most high
  yield DEX fee-paying asset on BSC and any othe chain we decide to deploy on,

4. New website in addition to the existing farm site.

5 Public roadmap

6. Public token distribution transparency

7. Burn?
